Please let me know when the build is ready for Outbrain testing.  There are some standout problems, such as 5 request per widget on the first article opened from the homepage.

I installed this build on a Nexus 4 and I see SDK_6 and SDK_3.  On Nexus 6, I see SDK_4 and SDK_1.

Here are some pointers for the client:
- Widgets cannot be preloaded.  There should be one unique request per widget per page.

[Internal Notes]
If these widgets will be subject to guarantee, they should not be requested until the user has clicked "More from CNN" and the drawer is visible.
